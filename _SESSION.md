# UpNext - Session State
Updated: 2026-02-19 | Branch: main

## Status: Build 14 complete — ready for TestFlight submit and App Store prep

### This Session
- **Build 14 created on EAS** — iOS production build with all 22 bug fixes including Bug #22 (watch history dedup)
  - Build number auto-incremented 13 → 14
  - EAS build: https://expo.dev/accounts/pwidds/projects/upnext/builds/100b49df-fb48-49a8-811a-c8fd560a1ea8
  - IPA artifact: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/2YUJASUYrdNAtUWc5SZ63Y.ipa
  - Pre-build checks passed: expo-doctor 17/17, git clean, TS clean (pre-existing NotificationsScreen type error only)
- **TestFlight submit needs `ascAppId`** — `eas submit --platform ios --latest` fails in non-interactive mode without it. Add `ascAppId` to `eas.json` submit profile for future non-interactive submits.
- **Build credits at 97%** for this month — be mindful of additional builds

### Files Modified This Session
- No code changes — this was a build-only session

### Next Session Priority Order
1. **Submit Build 14 to TestFlight** — Run `eas submit --platform ios --latest` in interactive terminal (needs Apple auth). Then add `ascAppId` to `eas.json` for future submits.
2. **Verify Build 14 on TestFlight** — Install, test Bug #22 fix (watch count stays at 1), smoke test all features
3. **App Store Connect remaining items**:
   - Resolve app name ("UpNext" is taken — try "UpNext: TV Tracker" or alternatives)
   - Clear marketing URL (still shows fake upnext.app)
   - Add test account credentials (test@test.com / test1234)
   - Confirm export compliance (no encryption)
   - Screenshots
4. **Create test account** — test@test.com / test1234 for Apple reviewer
5. **Submit for review** once build 14 is verified

- Schema: `tmdb_id` PK vs UNIQUE INDEX contradiction in `tracked_shows`
